WHAT THIS FILE DOES
------------------------------------------------------------
- Provides a simple speak() function for short voice prompts.
- On macOS, it uses the built-in "say" command (no setup needed).
- On other systems, it just prints the text (you still see the feedback).
- It also rate-limits messages so you don't get spammed.
